The directory contains classes useful in testing of web-clients.
They are written mainly with the necessity to test the class NSURLConnection
in mind.

TestCase
NSURLConnectionTest
	is a child of TestCase and represents a test of NSURLConnection.
	It starts a main instance and (if needed) an auxillary instance
	of TestWebServer (or uses externally supplied ones). Then it makes
	a custom request to check various functionality of NSURLConnection.

TestWebServer
	maintains it's own instance of SimpleWebServer and implements
	SimpleWebServer delegate's protocol to dispatch any request
	to a corresponding handler. It can call it's delegate during
	proceeding of requests.

RequestHandler
TestHandler and it's descendants
	handle requests (dispatched by TestWebServer) and produces
	a custom response. It also calls it's delegate (using TestWebServer
	delegate's protocol) during request handling.

SimpleWebServer
	The own implementation of a web server.

The key protocols important for understanding are TestProgress (TestCase.h)
and TestWebServerDelegate (TestWebServer.h). Alternatively the file 
NSURLConnectionTest.h briefly describes the whole picture.
