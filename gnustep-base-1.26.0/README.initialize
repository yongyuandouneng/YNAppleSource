The libobjc included with older versions of gcc does not have a thread-safe
implementation of the initialize method. This means that any classes not
already used may be incorrectly initialised, potentially causing strange
behaviors and crashes.

To put this into context, the runtime bug has been known for several years
and only rarely causes problems ... the easy workaround being to ensure that
any classes used by a new thread have already been used in the main thread
before the new thread starts.

If you are worried, please build/run GNUstep with a runtime which supports
the +initialize method. The GNUstep stable runtime (libobjc) and experimental
runtime (libobjc2), available from the GNUstep website and subversion
repository, should both work.

To disable this warning (eg. for an application which does not suffer any
problems caused by this runtime bug), please set the GSSilenceInitializeWarning
user default to YES.");
