.SH NAME
defaults - read or modify GNUstep user defaults

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B defaults [ action ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 'defaults' command lets you to read and modify a user's defaults.
.PP
This program replaces the old NeXTstep style dread, dwrite, and dremove

include \&'\-u username' before any other options to use that user's
database rather than your own.

defaults read [ domain [ key] ]

If no 'key' is given - read all defaults from the domain.
If no 'domain' is given - read all defaults from all domains.
A domain is either an application name, or "NSGlobalDomain", for system level
defauts.  (Running programs can access two other domains,
"NSArgumentDomain", for command line arguments, "NSRegistrationDomain", a
second-chance domain in which "defaults for defaults" can be registered, and
possibly domains for specific locales.)
