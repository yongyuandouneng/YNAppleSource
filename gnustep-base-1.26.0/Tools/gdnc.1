.TH GDNC 1 "August 2003" GNUstep "GNUstep System Manual"
.SH NAME
gdnc \- GNUstep Distributed Notification Center
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gdnc
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
The gdnc daemon is used by GNUstep programs to send notifications and 
messages to one another.  By default it uses private inter-process
communications accessible only to the curtrent user on the machine on
which it is running (where the operating system supports them).
.P
Every user needs to have his own instance of
.B gdnc
running. While
.B gdnc
will be started automatically as soon as it is needed,
it is recommended to start
.B gdnc
in a personal login script like ~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc.
Alternatively (if you have no command-line tools which use distributed
notifications) you can launch gdnc when your windowing system or the
window manager is started. For example, on systems with X11 you can launch
.B gdnc
from your .xinitrc script or alternatively
- if you are running Window Maker - put it in Window Maker's autostart script.
See the
.I GNUstep Build Guide
for a sample startup script.
.P
.SH OPTIONS

.B gdnc
to a remote session use the

.IP "\fB-GSNetwork YES"
.P
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
