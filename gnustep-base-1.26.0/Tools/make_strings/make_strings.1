.SH DESCRIPTION
.B make_strings
parses Objective-C files and builds lists of localizable strings.  It
then creates new
.I .strings
files or merges the strings with existing
.I .strings
files.  It's fairly intelligent when matching old and new strings, and
produces
.I .strings
files that are (supposed to be) easy for a translator to work with.
.PP
.B make_strings
accepts the following options:

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --help
Prints a short list of available options.
.TP
.B --verbose
Prints additional information while processing.
.TP
.BI -L " languages"
Specify which languages to process.  Multuple
.B -L
options are accepted, or multiple
.I languages
defined in one
.B -L
flag.
.TP
.B --aggressive-import
Activates
.B --aggresive-match
and automatically removes "dummy" entries that are added by importing
.I .strings
files which were not created by
.B make_strings
program.  This option is suitable when
.B make_strings
is run for the first time and there is an existing
.I .strings
file which contains a fairly accurate translation.
.TP
.B --aggressive-match
This option will make
.B make_strings
assume that matching keys should have matching translations.  This can
save lots of work, but it increases the risk of erroneous translation.
.TP
.B --aggressive-remove
Removes obsolete strings/keys.
