Description
-----------

make_strings parses Objective-C files and builds lists of localizable
strings. It then creates new .strings files or merges the strings with
existing .strings files. It's fairly intelligent when matching old
and new strings, and produces .strings files that are (supposed to be)
easy for a translator to work with.

Instructions on how to use it when translating can be found in Using.txt .


Installing
----------

make_strings requires gnustep-make and gnustep-base.

Running:
	make

should compile, and:
	make install

should install it.
