.SH NAME
GSDoc \- GNUstep XML documentation format

.SH DESCRIPTION
GSDoc is an XML language designed specifically for writing documentation for
the GNUstep project. In practice, that means that it is designed for writing
about software, and in particular, for writing about Objective-C classes.

.SH DEFINITION
The GSDoc markup language is defined by an SGML DTD, that specifies the tags
that may be used in marking up a GSDoc document, and how and where those tags
may be placed. The reader is encouraged to consult the DTD directly on any
points that the other documentation leaves unclear. The DTD is stored under
\fIGNUSTEP_SYSTEM_LIBRARY/DTDs\fR in a standard GNUstep installation...
where GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_LIBRARY is defined in the GNUstep configuration
file (GNUstep.conf).

.SH USAGE
GSDoc may be written by hand, but it is primarily autogenerated from
Objective-C source files by a tool called \fIautogsdoc\fR.
See the man page for that tool for more information.  This tool also converts
GSDoc into HTML for viewing.  In the future it is planned to convert the XML
into HTML, texinfo, man page, and other formats using XSLT.

.SH OTHER DOCUMENTATION
The primary documentation source for GSDoc is the GNUstep system HTML
documentation, under the Tools section.  In a standard GNUstep installation
this should be found under
\fIGNUSTEP_SYSTEM_DOC/Developer/Tools\fR...
where GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_DOC is defined in the GNUstep configuration
file (GNUstep.conf).
