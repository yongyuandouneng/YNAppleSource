.SH NAME
sfparse \- string file parse

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sfparse
[ \fI--utf8\fR | \fI--unicode\fR ] \fIfilename\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This tool has two different functions.  When invoked with just a filename as
argument, it checks that a file is a valid strings-file, which basically
amounts to seeing whether the file is in proper serialized NSDictionary format
(type "\fIdefaults plist\fR" for info on this).
.P
On the other hand, if one of the two options is given, no such checking is
performed, but the file IS converted into the named encoding.

.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB\-\-unicode\fR    - convert an ASCII or UTF8 file to Unicode
.P
\fB\-\-utf8\fR       - convert an ASCII or Unicode to UTF8
